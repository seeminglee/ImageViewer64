I have been looking into doing some audio / visual work on my Mac lately, 
and I feel that there has to be more than just Processing out there - which
as great as it is, is unfortunately Java based, and it not not feel as
second-nature to me.

It just so happens that I got really into Python lately so I looked into
some frameworks to do the work. Here I try to write a very simple app for
slide shows - very primitive code - I'm learning here! But I'm surprised
how much you can do with Python... it was further interesting to see that
the MVC + Design Patterns that I learned on event dispatching and so on while
working mostly in Flash - which feels like a decade ago - still feels very
similar today even though it's a completely different platform. Fun.

None of these are complete. The three libraries I worked on lat week are:

+ pygame
+ pyglet
+ cocos

PyGame works with SDL (with C Libraries). PyGlet uses the OpenGL library.
Cocos is based on PyGlet framework but also incorporates some SDL stuff.
Interesting overlaps there.

I am also experimenting with wxPython, Kivy and PyQt now that I realize that
desktop apps really aren't that different to program than web apps - plus
being able to string all these different programs together is really fun!
