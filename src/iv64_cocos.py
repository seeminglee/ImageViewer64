cocos_imageviewer. Third time is a charm? Testing cocos2d framework
which is based on the pyglet framework. It appears to have some more concrete
examples of how the authors envisioned apps be pieced together. Since it's
based on Pyglet, it also uses the very fast OpenGL underneath.
Let's see if this will cut my coding time by half.
